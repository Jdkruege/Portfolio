								<p>
									Hello! My name is Jonathan Krueger. I am currently a senior Iowa State University (ISU) in their Software Engineering program and will graduate in May 2016. 
                                    I am interested in producing games that are not only fun to play, but also easy to learn, and challenging to the people playing them.
								</p>
                                <p>
                                    I have developed several small games using XNA, Unity 5, Unreal Engine 4, and CryEngine 3 in order to help me better understand the strengths of each development enviornment. 
                                    Currently my focus is split between Unreal Engine 4 (Currently being used for one of my senior design projects) and Unity 5 (my preferrred development environment).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In this portfolio I plan to showcase my skills and education to potential employers. I hope in reviewing this portfolio you get a better sense of my abilities and my goals.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    During my sophomore year of highschool, I as offered a technical internship position with Rockwell Collins in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The company provided an in-depth course in software development using C++, 
                                    and then assigned me to real project task where I Ccould apply what I leanred. I remained in this position until heading off to college. This exprience influenced my decision to pursure a Software Engineering degree at ISU. During one of my review sessions, 
                                    the manager of the program told me that I had the skills to make a good manager someday.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I believe the Software Engineering program provided not only the technical training necessary, but also gave me a good foundation to communicate and work in a team environment.
                                    Through my assignments and experience here at ISU I have acquired team skills including cooperation, leadership, and communication; and I have applied these skills in each pgroup project.
                                    I am able to take either a leader or support role in a group, dpeneding on the current group dynamic. If leadership is needed I am able to step up to the task and try to build a consensus.
                                    However if somone else would prefer to lead I am willing to follow and support. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I am slo interested in developing softare for more general purposed. I am very resourceful , and am adept at locating, or creating, solutions to most issues. 
                                    I view engineering as a process of always learning new things; where each problem faced is an opportunity to acquire and apply new skills.
                                </p>

                                        This course gave me the fundamentals of how render objects in 3D space. It taught me about shaders, matrix manipulations, applying textures, and how to apply these concepts in a browser.
                                        This class taught me how to program graphics using WebGL via javascript, and briefly mentioned the intricacies of higher level languages. For the final presentation in this class I prototyped an
                                        algorithm that would create smooth randomly generated terrain using sample terrain tiles.

                                        After learning about graphics I decided to pursue a class dedicated to teaching the concepts of programming games. This class gave me introductions to XNA, Unity, AI algorithms, and some minor modelling in blender.
                                        I took part in a semester long professional project where we marketed, and developed, a game for the Battleship Iowa museum, working with a staff member on the ship. I also researched and presented a 30 minute tutorial
                                        on game creation using CryEngine 3, showing students how to build a simple game.

                                        Principles of Programming Languages was a class that focused on breaking down the common themes present in modern scripting languages. We studied an inhouse scripting language built using Java.
                                        The common idea of this course was to introduce a concept of a language, look at how to implement it, and then work with and extend the language. During our coursework we explored concepts such as: Grammars, Interpreters,
                                        Memory, Garbage Collection, Lambdas, Type checking, and variables. This class gave me an exceptional look into the mechanics that form languages I use everyday.

                                    <p>
                                        Software Project Management was a class that sought to teach students about the core responsibilites of a project manager. In this course students were split up into groups for four unique projects, 
                                        in which each student would be given the chance to be a manager. It was through the coursework and the projects that I was able to get a better understanding of team management, and truly understand all the responsibilities of a manager.
                                        We learned processes of production, project plan creation, design documentation, review standards, testing, and how to be a good manager.                            
                                    </p>

                                        Software Testing taught me so much about the testing process. It was during this course that I learned not only how to write sound, complete test, but also how to write code that was testable.
                                        Coursework also taught me about various methods of software testing, as well as ways to write, evaluate, and manage software test.

                                        Professional communication is something that all professionals should know, and it is a skill that software engineers need to know. 
                                        Coursework in this class aimed to teach us styles for writing internal and external emails, analyzing documents for correctness, and the skills needed
                                        to conduct presentations in focused mannner.

                                    For general education I took: Economics of Discrimination, World Religions, and Ethics
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In the short term, I hope to graduate college and get a job working at a game development company.
                                    I view the environment as extremely fun, and I think game developers provide enjoyment for many people.
                                    The work environment is very relaxed and the work sounds like it will be fun.
                                    I would love to be involved in a company like this, helping make games that people enjoy.
                                    The work requires knowledge of math and graphics, as well as programming challenges that occur with trying to add new ways to play.

                                    Ethics is a course that I believe will impact my future. It was through this course that I learned about moral dilemmas,
                                    and the tools needed to evaluate said dilemmas. This course taught me that there are multiple ways to view situations, and multiple ways to approach situations to
                                    ensure the most morally upright path is taken.
                                </p>

                                    I've had three software engineering courses that made a point to cover ethics, and my previous coursework helped me during these classes.
                                    Ethics is a very important concept in software engineering, as everyday more and more objects in our world are being run by computer programs.
                                    The wide spread effects of code that was built unethically could result in the deaths of a single hosptial patient who is undergoing treatments for a life threantening condition to the deaths of many thousands of people due to poorly managed nuclear control codes.
                                    The impacts of all decisions that we make in software design and implementation have far-ranging effects that we must consider, which is where a good handle on ethics comes in. I view my enrollment in an ethics course as a plan for my future creating
                                    ethically appropriate code.
                                </p>

                                    An example of applied ethics in action, occured during a project management course at ISU.
                                    The course had the class split up into teams to create a system that allowed teachers to automatically take attendance without all the tedium normally needed.
                                    During our project plan we had to come up with ethical ways of obtaining photos of each student for use by our facial recognition software.
                                    I view this as an example of applied ethics while creating an engineering solution.

                                    During the course of my education at Iowa State I have learned many skills that enable me to construct better solutions to every problem I face.
                                    The education I've gained during my schooling has given me the toolset needed to approach any technical problem I face and design a system to solve it.
                                    I can use these skills to help employers in the real world create low-cost, efficient systems.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    During my classes at ISU I have been given the opportunity to work in numerous groups. Some semester long projects, as well as quarter semester projects.
                                    Each project I have been involved in has taught me many concepts that I can carry with me to future projects. Group projects have enabled me to develop managerial experience,
                                    and cultivate skills that let me communicate to members, indifferent of their technical background. I am able to understand the role that professional responsibility has in a workplace, and I
                                    am familiar with the guidelines for evaluating ethnical problems that may arise as I work in the real world.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Class projects have helped in enriching my problem solving methodology. When I encounter a task that is outside my knowledge set I take to the internet and I begin searching for my problem and evaluating
                                    approaches that other people have made. With the knowledge I gain from online resources I can take another attempt at developing my solution and incorporating all the new information I have learned.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Outside of class I've been involved in Game Development club on campus. This is a club devoted to investigating what makes a game fun, and exploring how to make good games.
                                    We also host game jams for people to participate in, as well as workshops where members with a skill take an hour and teach other members how to do a certain task.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In my free time, outside of classes and clubs, I have taken up the hobby of game design. I seek to learn more about game programming through creating prototypes and seeing what I can do.
                                    I've learned skills like Unity and Unreal Engine 4 through this means, and when I think of a game concept that could be interesting to implement I take a crack at it and see how I do.
                                    I view learning through experimentation to be a learning style well suited to me.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If I were to re-start my ISU education, I would seek out courses I was really interested in earlier; as that would open more doors later on to other classes I would be interested in taking.
                                    I might also have taken my classes in a progression which enabled a more fluid learning experience; as opposed to the one I did which felt like it jumped around between concepts every semester.
                                </p>

										Apple Dropper as one of my first attempts at making a game in the Unity engine. Icreated the game in about four hours. 
                                        This game taught me how to set up the art in a game, build objects in the world to interact with, set up conditions for how the game ends, and how to program for the Unity engine. 
                                        I learned about C#, the main loop Unity uses, and how to access other gameobjects in numerous ways.

                                                Othello was an individual project for a computer game programming course. The game has been created using the Unity engine.
                                                The game has a two player mode, as well as an Artificial Intellignece mode with variable difficulties.

                                                Mars Rover Robot Simulation was a group project for an embedded systems course.
                                                I wrote low level system code to command an iRobot to traverse an obstacle course.
                                                I built a system that issues orders to a robot, I could not see, through bluetooth, while the device reported all sensor data back to me to analyze.

                                                Operation Twin Peaks was a smester-long group project for a software development course.
                                                My group attempted to build a first person shooter game in Java. We produced some base engine code, and some simple netcode, while learning a lot about how games need to be built.
                                                We took an agile development approach to the project, where we split up the task among our three members and tried to complete as much as we could in our given field.                                             
                                                I prototyped a terrain generation system that utilized black and white pictures, using some info I had read on the subject.
