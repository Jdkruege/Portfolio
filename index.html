								<p>
									My name is Jonathan Krueger. I am a senior in Software Engineering at Iowa State University. I am interested in producing games that are fun to play, easy to learn, 
                                    and enrich the lives of people playing them. I have worked with XNA, Unity 5, Unreal Engine 4, and CryEngine 3 to produce some small games, and get experience with 
                                    each engine. My current engines of focus are Unity 5, which I prefer to work with on most games, and Unreal Engine 4, which is the engine being used for one of my 
                                    senior design projects.
								</p>
                                <p>
                                    In this portfolio I hope to showcase my skills and education to the fullest. I hope in reviewing this document you get a better sense of my abilities and what I want to do with them.
                                    In 10th grade I joined a technical internship program with a company in my town, they helped teach me how to code, and assigned me to real task that needed to be done in the company.
                                    I stayed with this company into college and they always gave me meaningful work that I could learn new things doing, while also helping the company.
                                    The manager of the program told me during a review that I had the skills to make a good manager someday, so when I came to ISU I decided to persue a degree in Software Engineering.
                                    I view this degree as necessary to help me polish and hone my management skills, while giving me a good foundation to communicate and work in a team environment.
                                    I also am trying to persue some work in the game development field, as that is where I hope to wind up after graduation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I am also interested in building software for more general purposes. I am very resourceful, and am adept at locating, or creating, solutions to most issues I run into.
                                    I view engineering as a process of always learning new things, and each problem faced is an oppurtunity to learn. 
                                </p>
								<p>
									From my experiences here in college I have acquired skills in team: cooperation, leadership, and communication that I apply to each group project I am involved in. 
                                    I am able to take either a leader or a passive role in a group, depending on the current dynamic. If leadership is needed I am able to step up to the task and try 
                                    to fairly manage till a consensus is reached. But if someone else would prefer to lead I am capable of following without issue.

                                    For general education I took: Economics of Discrimination, World Religions, and Ethics
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In the short term, I hope to graduate college and get a job working at a game development company.
                                    I view the environment as extremely fun, and I see what game developers do as providing enjoyment for many people.
                                    The work environment is very relaxed and the work sounds like it will be fun.
                                    I would love to be involved in a company like this, helping make games that people enjoy.
                                    The work does require knowledge of math and graphics, as well as programming challenges that occur with trying to add new ways to play.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The only course that I believe impacts my education would be my course on ethics. It was through this course that I learned about moral dilemmas,
                                    and the tools needed to evaluate said dilemmas. This course taught me that there are multiple ways to view situations, and multiple ways to approach situations to
                                    ensure the most morally upright path is taken.
                                    <br /> <br />
                                    During my software engineering schooling I've had three classes that made a point to cover ethics, and my previous education has helped me during these sections.
                                    This is because ethics is a very important concept in software engineering, as everyday more and more objects in our world are being run by programs.
                                    The wide spread of effects of code that was not built ethically could result in the deaths of cities with poorly managed nuclear control codes, to even hospital
                                    patients who are undergoing treatments for life threatening conditions. The impacts of all decisions that we make in software design and implementation
                                    have effects that we must consider, which is where a good handle on ethics comes in. I view my enrollment in an ethics course as a plan for my future creating
                                    ethically appropriate code.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I only have one real instance of applied ethics during my time at ISU, and that was during a project management course.
                                    The course had the class split up into teams to create a system that allowed teachers to automatically take attendance without all the tedium normally needed.
                                    During our project plan we had to come up with ethical ways of obtaining photos to train each student against so they could be detected by our facial recgonition software.
                                    I view this as a decent example of applied ethics while creating an engineering solution.
                                </p>

										One of my first attempts at making a game in the Unity engine. Apple dropper was created in 4 hours of work, and was me applying concepts I learned to make a short game. This game taught me about how to set up the art in a game, build objects in the world to interact with, set up conditions for how the game ends, and how to program for unity. I learned about C#, the main loop unity uses, and how to access other gameobjects in numerous ways.

                                                Computer Science 437 project. Constructed the game of Othello in the Unity Engine with a two player mode and an AI with variable difficulty.
                                                I learned about using prepackaged components in my project.
                                                I also learned about basic AI creation. In the case of this project I learned the minimax algorithm and applied to to a variable difficulty AI.
                                                I took help from online sources that helped clarify minimax, and gave points about Unity concepts I didn't clearly understand.

                                                Computer Engineering 288 project. Wrote low level system code to command a IRobot create to traverse an obstacle course.
                                                I built a system that issues orders to a robot, I could not see, through bluetooth, while relaying sensor data back.
                                                I learned about low level design and the components needed to issue commands via registers.
                                                I learned about writing minimal, clean code to run on an embedded system.
                                                I also learned about calibrating and dealing with aging components.
                                                I gained these skills through the labs in this course, which allowed me to build everything I would need for this project

                                                Computer Science 309 semester project. Atempted to build a game in java, produced some base engine code, while learning a lot about how engines need to be built.
                                                We took an agile development approach to the project, where we split up the task among the 3 members and tried to complete as much as we could in our given field.
                                                I learned a lot about the complexities of a game engine, and how to structure the low level code.
                                                I also learned more about working with graphics in java, specifically rendering objects that I am given and applying textures to them. My techniques for this process came from taking a computer graphics course on campus.
                                                I prototyped a terrain generation system based on images, using some info I had read on the subject.
