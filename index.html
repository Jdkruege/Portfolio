                                Hello! My name is Jonathan Krueger. I am currently a senior Iowa State University (ISU) in their Software Engineering program
                                and will graduate in May 2016. I am interested in producing games that are not only fun to
                                play, but also easy to learn, and challenging to the people playing them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have developed several small games using XNA, Unity 5, Unreal Engine 4, and CryEngine 3 in order to help me better understand
                                the strengths of each development enviornment. Currently my focus is split between Unreal
                                Engine 4 (Currently being used for one of my senior design projects) and Unity 5 (my preferrred
                                development environment).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In this portfolio I plan to showcase my skills and education to potential employers. I hope in reviewing this portfolio you
                                get a better sense of my abilities and my goals.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During my sophomore year of highschool, I as offered a technical internship position with Rockwell Collins in Cedar Rapids,
                                Iowa. The company provided an in-depth course in software development using C++, and then
                                assigned me to real project task where I Ccould apply what I leanred. I remained in this
                                position until heading off to college. This exprience influenced my decision to pursure a
                                Software Engineering degree at ISU. During one of my review sessions, the manager of the
                                program told me that I had the skills to make a good manager someday.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I believe the Software Engineering program provided not only the technical training necessary, but also gave me a good foundation
                                to communicate and work in a team environment. Through my assignments and experience here
                                at ISU I have acquired team skills including cooperation, leadership, and communication;
                                and I have applied these skills in each pgroup project. I am able to take either a leader
                                or support role in a group, dpeneding on the current group dynamic. If leadership is needed
                                I am able to step up to the task and try to build a consensus. However if somone else would
                                prefer to lead I am willing to follow and support.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am slo interested in developing softare for more general purposed. I am very resourceful , and am adept at locating, or
                                creating, solutions to most issues. I view engineering as a process of always learning new
                                things; where each problem faced is an opportunity to acquire and apply new skills.

                                    This course gave me the fundamentals of how to render objects in 3D space. It taught me about shaders, matrix manipulations,
                                    applying textures, and how to apply these concepts in a browser. This class taught me
                                    how to program graphics using WebGL via Javascript, and briefly mentioned the intricacies
                                    of higher level languages. For the final presentation in this class I prototyped an algorithm
                                    that would create smooth randomly generated terrain using sample terrain tiles.

                                <p>
                                    After learning about graphics I decided to pursue a class dedicated to teaching the concepts of programming games. This class
                                    gave me introductions to XNA, Unity, AI algorithms, and some minor modelling in blender.
                                    I took part in a semester long professional project where we marketed, and developed,
                                    a game for the Battleship Iowa museum, working with a staff member on the ship. I also
                                    researched and presented a 30 minute tutorial on game creation using CryEngine 3, showing
                                    students how to build a simple game.

                                <p>
                                    Principles of Programming Languages was a class that focused on breaking down the common themes present in modern scripting
                                    languages. We studied an in-house scripting language built using Java. The central idea
                                    of this course was to introduce a concept of a language, look at how to implement it,
                                    and then work with and extend the language. During our coursework we explored concepts
                                    such as: Grammars, Interpreters, Memory, Garbage Collection, Lambdas, Type checking,
                                    and variables. This class gave me an exceptional look into the mechanics that form languages
                                    I use every day.

                                    Software Project Management was a class that sought to teach students about the core responsibilities of a project manager.
                                    In this course students were split up into groups for four unique projects, in which
                                    each student would be given the chance to be a project manager. It was through the coursework
                                    and the projects that I was able to get a better understanding of team management, and
                                    truly understand all the responsibilities of a manager. I learned processes of production,
                                    project plan creation, design documentation, review standards, testing, and how to be
                                    a good manager.

                                    Software Testing taught me a lot about the testing process. It was during this course that I learned how to write
                                    sound, complete test scenarios and how to write code that was testable. This course also taught
                                    me about various software testing methodologies, as well as ways to write, evaluate, and
                                    manage test suites for produced software.

                                        Apple Dropper was one of my first attempts at making a game in the Unity engine. I created the game in about four hours. This
                                        game taught me how to set up the art in a game, build objects in the world to interact
                                        with, set up conditions for how the game ends, and how to program for the Unity engine.
                                        I learned about C#, the main loop Unity uses, and how to access other gameo bjects in
                                        numerous ways.

                                        Area collect was a game I made about quick use of the mouse. It's a simple game where the player controls a dot and has to navigate areas to earn points.
                                        Players control the object with their mouse, so speed is dependent on how fast you move the mouse. When you hit an object you become disabled
                                        for 3 seconds, in which you can not do anything. You also have limited lives, so you can't abuse the immunity.

                                            Operation Twin Peaks was a smester-long group project for my software development course. My group attempted to build a first

                                            netcode, while learning a lot about how games need to be built. We took an Agile
                                            development approach to the project, where we split up the task among our three
                                            members and tried to complete as much as we could in our given field. I prototyped
                                            a terrain generation system that utilized black and white pictures, using some
                                            info I had read on the subject.

                            <p>
                                My current focus is working on my senior design project. My project is the production of a wireless controller that can be used in freshman programming labs to engage students in programming. 
                                The idea behind this project is to engage students taking their first college class and make their first programming language fun. We have also been told this controller will be used
                                in our customer's summer STEM program he runs with the local high school. I view this project as an opportunity to show off all the skills I have learned, while growing STEM interest in my community.
                                I think this project is very important, as creating and retaining interest in STEM programs is necessary for our growing technological world.

                                Our system is built on a combination of C and C++ code, utilizing libraries for Bluetooth, SPI, and I2S. 
                                We are working on an Intel Edison, which is a Yocto Linux microcontroller.

                        <p>
                            Through this project I have learned a lot about designing a system outside a classroom environment. In this project I do not have a grading standard or guide for how to make designs,
                            so it comes down to evaluation of options and making choices that we, as a team, decide are best. We have had to make numerous decisions on this project regarding hardware components needed
                            as well as software architecture.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When it comes to making APIs and extendable classes that students will need to use, we had to put a lot of consideration into them. We knew for a intro to programming course, requiring 
                            students to look at and create code that requires numerous lines to execute one task may be too stressful on them, so we decided we can abstract out all of that code into small, well defined API sets.
                            This way students can call a method to read a sensor, or write to a sensor with no hassle. We also built extendable classes into our code, so students can build their own programs without
                            knowledge of high-level concepts like threads.

                        <h3>Outside of Class</h3>  

                        <p>
                            Outside of my college work, I try to independently design and develop games of varying complexities. I also aim to write blog post about interesting things you can do in Unity as I learn them.
                            Below is listed a link to my Trello board where I try to track my current task for the week, and further below is where I will be posting blogs.
