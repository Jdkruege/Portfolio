    In this portfolio I hope to showcase my skills and education to the fullest. I hope in reviewing this document you get a better sense of my abilities and what I want to do with them.
    In 10th grade I joined a technical internship program with a company in my town, they helped teach me how to code, and assigned me to real task that needed to be done in the company.
    I stayed with this company into college and they always gave me meaningful work that I could learn new things doing, while also helping the company.
    The manager of the program told me during a review that I had the skills to make a good manager someday, so when I came to ISU I decided to persue a degree in Software Engineering.
    I view this degree as necessary to help me polish and hone my management skills, while giving me a good foundation to communicate and work in a team environment.
    I also am trying to persue some work in the game development field, as that is where I hope to wind up after graduation.
