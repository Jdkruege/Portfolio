    For general education I took: Economics of Discrimination, World Religions, and Ethics

    In the short term, I hope to graduate college and get a job working at a game development company.
    I view the environment as extremely fun, and I see what game developers do as providing enjoyment for many people.
    The work environment is very relaxed and the work sounds like it will be fun.
    I would love to be involved in a company like this, helping make games that people enjoy.
    The work does require knowledge of math and graphics, as well as programming challenges that occur with trying to add new ways to play.

    The only course that I believe impacts my education would be my course on ethics. It was through this course that I learned about moral dilemmas,
    and the tools needed to evaluate said dilemmas. This course taught me that there are multiple ways to view situations, and multiple ways to approach situations to
    ensure the most morally upright path is taken.

    During my software engineering schooling I've had three classes that made a point to cover ethics, and my previous education has helped me during these sections.
    This is because ethics is a very important concept in software engineering, as everyday more and more objects in our world are being run by programs.
    The wide spread of effects of code that was not built ethically could result in the deaths of cities with poorly managed nuclear control codes, to even hospital 
    patients who are undergoing treatments for life threatening conditions. The impacts of all decisions that we make in software design and implementation
    have effects that we must consider, which is where a good handle on ethics comes in. I view my enrollment in an ethics course as a plan for my future creating
    ethically appropriate code.

    I only have one real instance of applied ethics during my time at ISU, and that was during a project management course.
    The course had the class split up into teams to create a system that allowed teachers to automatically take attendance without all the tedium normally needed.
    During our project plan we had to come up with ethical ways of obtaining photos to train each student against so they could be detected by our facial recgonition software.
    I view this as a decent example of applied ethics while creating an engineering solution.
