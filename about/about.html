        My name is Jonathan Krueger. I am a senior in Software Engineering at Iowa State University. I am interested in producing games that are fun to play, easy to learn, 
        and enrich the lives of people playing them. I have worked with XNA, Unity 5, Unreal Engine 4, and CryEngine 3 to produce some small games, and get experience with each engine.
        My current engines of focus are Unity 5, which I prefer to work with on most games, and Unreal Engine 4, which is the engine being used for one of my senior design projects.

        I am also interested in building software for more general purposes. I am very resourceful, and am adept at locating, or creating, solutions to most issues I run into.
        I view engineering as a process of always learning new things, and each problem faced is an oppurtunity to learn.

        From my experiences here in college I have acquired skills in team: cooperation, leadership, and communication that I apply to each group project I am involved in.
        I am able to take either a leader or a passive role in a group, depending on the current dynamic. If leadership is needed I am able to step up to the 
        task and try to fairly manage till a consensus is reached. But if someone else would prefer to lead I am capable of following without issue.
