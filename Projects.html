        <h4 class="head">- Apple Dropper:</h4>
        <p class="tab">
            One of my first attempts at making a game in the Unity engine. Apple dropper was created in 4 hours of work, and was me applying concepts I learned to make a short game. 
            This game taught me about how to set up the art in a game, build objects in the world to interact with, set up conditions for how the game ends, and how to program for unity.
            It's a game where you play as a farmer with the goal of picking up apples that drop from your trees. You need to collect the good apples while avoiding the rotten ones.
            The goal is to see how many you can catch before the game ends.
