            Working to produce a replacement lab tool to help teach freshman computer, electrical, and software engineering students C.
            I am one of the two concept holders for the team, where my job is to remember the key information needed to make decisions.
            Currently I am contributing to the development of system specs, and brainstorming possible tools we could create.

        <p class="tab">
            Together with a team of artist and programmers, we are designing and developing a game in Unreal Engine 4.
            I am one of 3 programmers on a team of 6, my duty currently is to develope the key mechanics our game will need.
            I am currently learning Unreal Engine, coming from a Unity standpoint, and I'm learning about all the differences between the two engines.

        <h4 class="head">- Operation Twin Peaks:</h4>
        <p class="tab">
            Computer Science 309 semester project. Atempted to build a game in java, produced some base engine code, while learning a lot about how engines need to be built. 
            We took an agile development approach to the project, where we split up the task among the 3 members and tried to complete as much as we could in our given field.
            I learned a lot about the complexities of a game engine, and how to structure the low level code.
            I also learned more about working with graphics in java, specifically rendering objects that I am given and applying textures to them. My techniques for this process came from taking a computer graphics course on campus. 
            I prototyped a terrain generation system based on images, using some info I had read on the subject.

        <h4 class="head">- Othello:</h4>
        <p class="tab">
            Computer Science 437 project. Constructed the game of Othello in the Unity Engine with a two player mode and an AI with variable difficulty.
            I learned about using prepackaged components in my project.
            I also learned about basic AI creation. In the case of this project I learned the minimax algorithm and applied to to a variable difficulty AI.
            I took help from online sources that helped clarify minimax, and gave points about Unity concepts I didn't clearly understand.

        <p class="tab">
            Computer Engineering 288 project. Wrote low level system code to command a IRobot create to traverse an obstacle course.
            I built a system that issues orders to a robot, I could not see, through bluetooth, while relaying sensor data back.
            I learned about low level design and the components needed to issue commands via registers.
            I learned about writing minimal, clean code to run on an embedded system.
            I also learned about calibrating and dealing with aging components.
            I gained these skills through the labs in this course, which allowed me to build everything I would need for this project

        <h4 class="head">- Apple Dropper:</h4>
        <p class="tab">
            One of my first attempts at making a game in the Unity engine. Apple dropper was created in 4 hours of work, and was me applying concepts I learned to make a short game. 
            This game taught me about how to set up the art in a game, build objects in the world to interact with, set up conditions for how the game ends, and how to program for unity.
            I learned about C#, the main loop unity uses, and how to access other gameobjects in numerous ways.
