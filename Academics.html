    <p>
           In the short term, I hope to graduate college and get a job working at a game development company. 
           I view what these people do as helping provide entertainment to many people. 
           The work environment is very relaxed and the work sounds like it will be fun.
           I would love to be involved in a company like this, helping make games that people enjoy. 
           The work does require knowledge of math and graphics, as well as programming challenges that occur with trying to add new ways to play.
